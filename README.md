# Steel Plate Defect Prediction üçΩÔ∏è

**2024 Kaggle Playground Series** - Season 4, Episode 3
The competition page can be found [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e3/).

### Basic Info
* **Goal** : Predict the probability of various defects on steel plates. There are in total 7 defect categories: `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`, `Stains`, `Dirtiness`, `Bumps`, `Other_Faults`. Each defect is a binary label, and each plate can have multiple defects.
* **Evaluation** : AUC

### Notebooks
* [Test run with XGB+Optuna](defect-prediction-xgb-optuna-trial.ipynb) -  0.89388

### Works Done
* Feature engineering (generate new features)
* Explore the use of MLP (Training time is too long...)
* Consider stacking/ensembling

### Result
* Final Score: 0.88746
* Final Standing: 311/2199 (Top 1: 0.88977)
